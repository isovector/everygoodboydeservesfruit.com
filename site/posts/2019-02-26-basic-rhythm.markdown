It's said that music is made up of three fundamental pieces---the rhythm, the
harmony, and the melody. If you had asked me a month ago which of these was the
most important, I'd unhesitatingly say "the melody."

I was wrong. It's the rhythm. Music without melody is ambient, but [as we
learned in the last post][basics], music without rhythm is pretty dang boring.

When I began seriously studying music, I couldn't hold a beat to save my life. A
lifetime of playing classical music meant that *continuity* was never as
important to me as *playing the right notes.* As such, whenever I screwed up,
I'd stop and start again from the top. As you can imagine, this was not
particularly helpful for my sense of rhythm.

Do you know what was? Playing with the metronome. A lot. Starting today, *every
time you practice,* use the metronome for the entire session.

Anyway. It's amazing what having the right groove can do to a song. I was ignoring this
for the two years I was teaching myself guitar. Even if you're playing the right
chords, it just doesn't sound like the right song until the beat is in place.

Let's go back to our [Wagon Wheel][wagon] example from the other day. Because we
were focusing only on getting the chords right, we were playing it with this
rhythm:

```music
4/4 X:4 X:4 X:4 X:4
```

It didn't sound amazing---but what makes the recording more interesting? Well,
the actual rhythm that ol' Darius is hammering out is something more like this:

```music
4/4 %:16 X:16 %:8 X:4 X:8 %:16 X:16 X:8 X:8
```

Now I'm not going to claim that I'm a rhythmic expert and somehow just picked
this out of the air. What I actually did was turn my keyboard volume down to 0,
jammed along to the recording, and hit notes whenever they felt right. Then I
used some software to turn me randomly hitting keys into rhythm notation.

The point is that *nobody cares* whether or not the rhythm I've written down is
correct. The point is that it's easy to instantly come up with something
close-to-right. Just put on a recording and hit notes whenever they feel like
they'd groove.

Play the groove until you've internalized it, and then see if you can reproduce
it without the recording. You'll be amazed at how much better it sounds already.
