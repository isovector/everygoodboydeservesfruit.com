Let's get you up and running. Today we'll talk about enough of the very basics
to get you to a point where you can play music with other people. It's not going
to be award-winning by any means, but it'll be *enough.*

Get started first; get amazing later.

You'll need to know the following chords:


```music
treble C GM:1 DM:1 Em:1 CM:1
```
<!-- !AnnotateBars [Maj G, Maj D, Min E, Maj C] -->

```chords
G | D | Em | C
```

The chords $Maj G$, $Maj D$ and $Maj C$ are pronounced "G major," "D major" and
"C major" respectively. $Min E$ is called "E minor." We'll discuss where these
chords come from and what they mean another time; today it's sufficient to just
memorize them.

Popular music is often transcribed in the form of chord sheets. A good place to
find music for anything you're looking for is [Ultimate-Guitar.Com][chords].
Don't let the word "guitar" fool you---the music is the same for every
instrument!

Today we'll be looking at the song [Wagon Wheel][wagon], whose chord sheet looks
like this:

[wagon]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvKyBcCDOB4

```chords
G | D | Em | C
G | D | C
```

Each of the vertical lines corresponds to a bar, and so this chord sheet means
to play one bar of $Maj G$, then one bar of $Maj D$, etc. When you get to the
end, start again at the beginning. Rinse and repeat while singing until you run
out of words.

Chord sheets are intentionally terse; they offer a very rough guideline of how
the song should be played, but don't really tell you how to do it. This is the
primary skill we'll be developing throughout the next few lessons.

Today, however, we'll just hammer out the chord in four quarter notes for each
bar. Let's interpret the chord sheet above as the following:

```music
treble 4/4
GM GM GM GM
DM DM DM DM
Em Em Em Em
CM CM CM CM
GM GM GM GM
DM DM DM DM
CM CM CM CM
```

Congratulations! You've now part of a *very exclusive* club of musicians who can
play Wagon Wheel. Memorize these chord changes, and invite some friends over for
a jam sesh.

It might sound silly, but a huge portion of playing music is just this---knowing
and playing the chord changes. The rest is just embellishment.

So, what does embellishment look like? Really anything that adds some interest
to the music. For example, we can break the chords:

```music
treble 4/4
GM[0,12,0,12]
DM[0,12,0,12]
Em[0,12,0,12]
CM[0,12,0,12]
GM[0,12,0,12]
DM[0,12,0,12]
CM[0,12,0,12]
```

That's already sick, that. But you know what you wanna do with that right? You
wanna put a bangin' donk on it:

```music
bass 4/4
G2:2 G2:2
D3:2 D3:2
E3:2 E3:2
C3:2 C3:2
G2:2 G2:2
D3:2 D3:2
C3:2 C3:2
```

It's sort of silly how much better a little embellishment sounds already, isn't
it? We'll progress from here by looking at small, simple adornments can be
quickly learned, and layered for great effect.

**For practice**, familiarize yourself with playing songs and singing along to
them. You can let your vocals carry most of the musical weight; for now your
instrumentation is best considered as accompaniment. Practice with a metronome
and make sure your chord changes are on the beat. Play music using both hands,
and build independence between the two by playing them at different times. Find
some other four-chord songs to play---[here's an easy and fun way to find some
that you already know][fourchord].
